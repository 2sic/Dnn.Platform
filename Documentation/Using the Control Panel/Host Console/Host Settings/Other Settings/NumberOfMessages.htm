        <h1>Setting the Number of Messages sent in each Batch</h1>
        <p>How to set the number of messages that will be sent by the messaging scheduler in each batch. This setting is designed to help you avoid overloading your mail servers with lots of messages, or in the case of sites running on shared hosting environments to ensure you don’t violate the terms and conditions of your hosting. For example, some shared hosting sites limit mails to a few thousand a day – as the setting is per each run of the scheduled task which is 1 minute , 50 per batch would be 72000 mails a day.</p>
