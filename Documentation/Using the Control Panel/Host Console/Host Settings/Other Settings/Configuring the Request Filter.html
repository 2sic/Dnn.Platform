        <h1>Configuring the Request Filter</h1>
        <p>Each rule element in the request filter defines a simple matching expression and the action to take if a match is found. You can define as many rules as needed. This provides a flexible "or" operation where any one rule can cause the request to be blocked.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Rule Attributes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>servervar</b>: This is the name of a Server variable from the Request.ServerVar hash table. See: http://www.w3schools.com/asp/coll_servervariables.asp</li>
    <li><b>operator</b>: Defines the operation that determines whether an actual match exists. Valid values: Regex, Equal, NotEqual
    <ul>
        <li><b>Regex</b>: Uses the regular expression specified in the value attribute to determine a match.</li>
        <li><b>Equal</b>: Performs a search of the value list to determine if the value of the specified server variable is in the value list.</li>
        <li><b>NotEqual</b>: Performs a search of the value list to determine if the value of the specified server variable does not exist in the value list.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>value</b>: Defines the value of the servervar that triggers the rule. For a regex rule, the value should be a regular expression that used as a matching expression.
    If this is not a regex operation, then value can be a semicolon delimited list of values. For example it could include a list of IP addresses that should be blocked.
    <ul>
        <li><b>action</b>: Defines the action to take if a match occurs. Valid values: NotFound, Redirect, PermanentRedirect.</li>
        <li><b>NotFound</b>: Returns a 404 status code and stops all further response processing.</li>
        <li><b>Redirect</b>: Performs a standard redirect to the URL specified in the location attribute.</li>
        <li><b>PermanentRedirect</b>: Performs a permanent redirect (status code 301) to the URL specified in the location attribute.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>location</b>: The URL where the request will be redirected. This can be left blank for the 'NotFound' action.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering from Errors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It is possible to lock yourself out of the web site if you incorrectly configure a rule. For example if you intend to prevent an IP address from accessing the site, you might want to create a rule like the one below:&lt; rule servervar="REMOTE_ADDR" values="205.196.10.2" operator="Equal" action="Redirect" location="<code>http://www.awesomecycles.biz"</code>"</li>
    <li>If you inadvertently selected the 'NotEqual' operator you would actually lock out everyone except the specified IP. To recover from this error, you must edit the DotNetNuke.config file to correct the rule, or edit the web.config to remove the request filter from the HTTPModules section.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Installation/Upgrade:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The appropriate HTTPModule entry has been added to the Development.config and Release.config files and will be available for use automatically when installing a new DotNetNuke site. However, the Host Administrator will still need to enable the feature and on the "Host Settings" page before they can create any rules and use the feature. If the DotNetNuke.config file does not exist in the root directory, then it will be automatically created from the template provided in the Config directory.</li>
    <li>Users who are upgrading from a previous DotNetNuke version will need to add the following entry to the HTTPModules section of their web.config file.</li>
</ul>
